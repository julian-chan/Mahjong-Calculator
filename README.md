# Mahjong-Calculator
GUI built using Java and the JavaFX library to allow a user to select tiles for the winning hand and enter in other parameters (seat, round, self-drawn) to compute the score for that hand.

An executable file will be generated soon to be run on Windows. No plans have been made for a version for MacOS yet.
